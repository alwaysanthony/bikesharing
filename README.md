## Summary

We were able to visualize the data using tableau. This allowed to notice trends. One trend was that males used the bikes more than females. The other trend was noticing that the most popular ride times are around 5pm and 6pm and on Thursday. Knowing this we could probably cater more to females to increase number of rides. We can also use popular rides times to show potential investors popular times to place ads for more revenue.
